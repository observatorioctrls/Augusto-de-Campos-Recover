    <b>QUESTIONNAIRE OF THE YALE SYMPOSIUM ON EXPERIMENTAL, VISUAL AND CONCRETE
    POETRY SINCE THE 1960'S
    (April 5-7, 1995)</b>
    <p>
    (Questions formulated by K.David Jackson, Eric Vos & Johanna Drucker.
    Replies by Augusto de Campos, translated by K.David Jackson)
    <p>
    <b>1. What dimensions of contemporary poetics are directly engaged with
    concretism?</b>
    <p>
    <b>A</b>. I see Concrete poetry as directly engaged with the practices of
    vanguard, experimental or - as it should probably
    more adequately be called - inventive poetry. I think that the task of
    Concrete poetry, after it appeared in the 50s, was
    to reestablish contact with the poetry of the vanguards of the beginning
    of the century (Futurism, Cubofuturism, Dada
    et alia), which the inlervention of two great wars and the proscription
    of Nazi and Stalinist dictatorships had
    condemned to marginalization. A similar movement occurred in the 50s in
    music, with the recuperation of the work of
    the Vienna Group (Schoenberg, Webern, Berg), the rediscovery of the
    great indnidual experimentalists (Ives, Varese,
    etc.), and the intervention of new vanguard composers, from Boulez to
    Stockhausen to Cage. In terms of the poets
    whom Pound termed "masters," "diluters," etc., the practitioners of
    Concrete poetry situate themselves, or hope to be
    situated, programmatically, in the category of the "inventors," that is,
    those who are engaged in the pursuit of new
    forms.
    <p>
    <b>2. How do you see the historical precedents of your own Concrete work?
    If you are not discussing your own work,
    please select a specific text on which to base your comments.</b>
    <p>
    <b>A</b>. For me, the dividing line for inventive poetic language in modern
    times is Mallarme's work Un coup de dés (1897), a
    poem conceivod intersemiotically as a fragmentary structure
    ("subdivisions prismatiques de l'Idée"), conjoining visual
    mural and musical score. With the acceptance of that work, it became
    possible to revisit the experiences of the
    vanguards of the beginning of the century and conceive of new
    elaborations. "Sans presumer de l'avenir qui sortira
    d'ici, rien ou presque un art," the last Mallarme - from Un coup de dés
    to Le Livre catalyzes and spreads the principal
    future alternatives of poetic language. In his final period and in the
    subsequent developments of the historical
    vanguards, which will be recycled and radicalized by Concrete poetry,
    one encounters the formal presuppositions of
    the poetry of the Technological Era, which greatly expands throughout
    the second half of the century. Besides
    Mallarmé and the historical vanguards, I would place as direct
    precedents Ezra Pound (the ideogrammatic method,
    the collage and metalanguage of the Cantos), James Joyce (the
    vocabulistic kaleidoscope of Finnegans Wake and its
    textual polyreadings), Cummings (the atomization and syntactical
    dislocation of his most experimental poems), and,
    on a second level, more idiosyncratic and less rigorous, the
    experimental, minimalist, and molecular prose of
    Gertrude Stein. In the special case of Brazilian poetry, the Sousandrade
    of O inferno de Wall Street (The Wall Street
    Hell) with its precollage epigrammatic mosaics, Oswald de Andrade and
    the "anthropophagic" instantpoem, the
    constructivist engineering of João Cabral [de Melo Neto]. In a
    transdisciplinary mode, I would mention the
    transformations of musical language from Webern to Cage and of the
    visual from Malevich/Mondrian to Duchamp.
    <p>
    <b>3. What are the theorectical underpinnings which distinguish your works
    from that of historical precedentes or
    contemporaries?</b>
    <p>
    <b>A</b>. In view of the specific historical context in which it occurred,
    Concrete poetry obviously did not participate either in
    the ideology of Symbolism, which still underlies Mallarme's poetics, or
    in the mecanopolitical Futurist utopias, or in
    Dadaist nihilism. Concrete poetry took a position as a poetics of
    objectivity, attempting simply to place its premises at
    the roots of language, with the intention of creating new operational
    conditions for the elaboration of a poem in the
    sphere of technological revolution. Technically, Concrete poets can be
    distinguished from their antecedents by the
    radicalization and condensation ofthe means of structuring a poem, on
    the horizon of the means of communication of
    the second half of the century.That implies, among other
    characteristics, the following: greater constructive rigor in
    relation to the graphic experiences of Futurists and Dadaists; greater
    concentration of vocabulary; emphasis on the
    nondiscursive character of poetry, suppression or relativization of
    syntactic links; making explicit the materiality of
    language in its visual and sonorous dimensions; free passage between
    verbal and nonverbal levels.
    <p>
    Poems such as "terra" by Décio Pignatari or "cristal" by Haroldo de
    Campos, from the 50s, or my "cidadecitycite" or
    "olho por olho" from the 60s typify these characteristics.
    <p>
    Concrete poets may be differentiated from other experiences (zaum,
    lettrisme, phonetic poetry) for not rejecting
    semantic values but rather placing them on equal footing with other
    material, visual, and sonorous parameters of the
    poem. They differentiate themselves from the "chance poetry" of Cage and
    others for not abdicating control of the
    structure of the poem, although allowing for chance interventions.
    <p>
    <b>4. To what extent is the work you are discussing different from the work
    of the concrete poets of the 1950s and 1960s?
    How?</b>
    <p>
    <b>A</b>. Now four decades since the first experiences of Concrete poetry, I
    would say that the 50s and 60s were the period of
    greatest orthodoxy of the movement, something like the serialization of
    all musical parameters proposed by European
    postWebernian musicians. In the later decades there occurred a greater
    flexibility of poetic language in the sense of
    recuperation of phrasic structures (in relation to the elementarism of
    the first phase, with poems made up of only one
    word or of a few spatialized substantives) and of the inclusion of
    chance (with the interventions of Cage), but that
    flexibility always observed a compositional rigor and the principle of
    functionality or of the formal necessity of the
    poem. Such an opening became inevitable in view of the redundancy of
    process and of its degradation, brought about
    by the ineffectiveness of many realizations, especially in the area of
    visual poetry, characterized by a semantic
    insignificance analogous to many baroque graphic "labyrinths," which,
    with the superficiality of repeated graphic
    emblems, did not amount to more than the vacuity of epithalamian or
    funerial elegies. Such an opening should not be
    confused either with with the apparent complexity of the simply chaotic
    surrealist texts that used graphic space
    without any satisfactory formal basis. Works of the 80s and 90s are, on
    the one hand, freer in relation to the orthodoxy
    of the first years and, on the other, more intensely participatory in
    the challenge of new technologies, which have
    produced digitalized poems, graphic and sound animation, and multimedia
    and intermedia processes. In this way, the
    "wishful thinking" of the 50s came about with computers, an ideal space
    for "verbivocovisual" adventures.
    <p>
    <b>5. Is there a poetics of concretism or is concrete poetry a formal
    device rather than a conceptual premise?</b>
    <p>
    <b>A</b>. As I see it, Concrete poetry did not come about as a formal
    specialization in the field of modern poetry, as one
    could speak of carmenfiguratum in antiquity, but rather as a proposed
    radicalization of poetic language in which the
    visual aspects constitute just one of the relevant parameters. What
    Concrete poetry sought was to recuperate the
    specificity of poetic language itself, the materiality of the poem and
    its autonomy, beginning with a revision and
    radicalization of the methods of modern poetry and of the elaboration of
    a new creative project in the context of new
    media.
    <p>
    <b>6. Thesis: "Concretism, one of the most radical avant­garde trends of
    this century engaged in a critical reevaluation of
    the artistic object and its place in society, had a new way of looking
    at and reading tradition. It was a forerunner of
    later neo­baroque and post­modern trends."
    Please give your evaluation or judgment of this artist's perspective
    from an artist's participant's point of view, as it
    relates to your own work or poetics, or to your critical judgment of
    concretist experimentation.</b>
    <p>
    <b>A</b>. I don't think that either of the expressions - "neobaroque" or
    "postmodern" - are sufficiently adequate to
    characterize the actual moment in its possible relations with Concrete
    poetry. The term "neobaroque" is too charged
    with historicity and could lead to confusions, if one considers that it
    usually takes in practices of Hispanic and Latin
    American poetry not connected to the poetics of concretism. As to
    "postmodern," it is a concept of indefinite contours,
    hardly defensible, to the degree that the presuppositions of "modern"
    are still in effect; it seems rather to be a label
    that serves as a pretext for ecleticisms of a conservative nature,
    actually pre or antimodernist. I would stop at the first
    phrase of the thesis, adding in place of "It was a forerunner, etc."
    that Concrete poetry once again took up
    speculations of an experimental lineage in contemporary poetry, forming
    relevant presuppositions for the
    development of poetry in the context of new media that are growing in
    the technological phase of modernity. It
    constituted, at the least, an important movement for keeping alive the
    revolutionary ideology of permanent and
    autonomous experimentation and redefining vanguard action in the second
    half of the century, assuming this position
    under the category of "poetry of invention" (in contrast to the more
    palatable "expressive poetry") as a means of
    resistance against the massification and the banalization of literature
    imposed by the new means of communication
    and the stagnation of conventional literature.<p>
